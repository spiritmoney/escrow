# Escrow Application for Espees

## Project Overview

The Escrow Application is designed to facilitate safe and secure trading of goods and services using Espees as the currency. By acting as an intermediary, the platform ensures that transactions between buyers and sellers are fair, transparent, and secure. This application aims to promote the use of Espees in everyday transactions, thereby increasing its adoption and integration into daily life.

## Running the Project

To run the NestJS project, follow these steps:

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run start:dev
   ```

3. For production, build and start the server:
   ```
   npm run build
   npm run start:prod
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```
   npm run test
   ```

5. Run e2e tests:
   ```
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

6. Check code linting:
   ```
   npm run lint
   ```

7. Format code:
   ```
   npm run format
   ```

Make sure you have the necessary environment variables set up before running the project.
